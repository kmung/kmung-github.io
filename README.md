Repository for my personal site

Personal website with portfolio of pages.
This repository contains all the HTML, CSS, Javascript and other files used to create my personal site.
My site is a platform for me to practice web development and to showcase projects I've worked on and currently work on.

You can visit my site by clicking here: https://kmung.github.io

This is a work in progress.
