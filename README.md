Repository for my personal site

Personal website with portfolio of pages.
This repository contains all the HTML, CSS, Javascript and other files used to create my personal site.
My site is a platform for me to practice web development and to showcase projects I've worked on and currently work on.

You can visit my site by clicking here: https://kmung.github.io

My site is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Incorporating Bootstrap classes to make my site more responsive. I started building this site using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (along with JQuery library), so going back and incorporating Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript is similar to updating the support beams of an already built house.

This is a work in progress.
